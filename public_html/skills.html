	<h3> What I bring you </h3>
	<hr class="long">
	<p> There are plenty of web developers on the internet. I count a fair share of them among my friends and twitter followers. Before I write about my skills for web development, I'd like to take a minute to talk to you about the skills I've gained outside. These are the unique offerings I can bring to you. </p>
	<hr class="short">
	<p> As an academic, I've learned that learning never stops. I've presented at national conferences numerous times, earned an advanced degree, and taught many wonderful people. By teaching at a university level for the past decade, I've learned how people learn and communicate. I believe that I excel in these regards- I will be able to tell you, in simple English, what I'm doing at every step of the way. </p>
	<p> I'm creative. This should almost go without saying: I've spent years talking about monster and made that into a paying job. I've written numerous essays on texts which have been studied for two millenia- finding new and novel ways to frame them and say something exciting about them. I believe these skills transfer extremely well into building websites: I can see your business for what it is and find new ways to attract customers by showing it at a different angle. </p>
	<hr class="short">
	<p> As far as web development skills are concerned, for HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript, I'm your guy. I've taken courses all across the internet on these topics- at well known online schools like Team Treehouse, Codeschool, and Udemy. I also have training in jQuery, AngularJS, Responsive and Mobile First Web Design practices.</p>
