		<h3> My Story </h3>
		<hr class="long">
		<img id="profile"class="center image" src="images/profile.png" alt="profile photo"/>
		<p> Hi there, everyone. My name is James Hamilton- I'm a web developer. Well- perhaps that's a misdirection. I build things. Websites are only one of those things. If anything, I love to build stories and experiences. I've found that code is an excellent medium to do so- it's language that is given shape and visual expression.</p>

<!-- THE FOLLOWING IS wide only ONLY -->
	<div class="mobonly">
	<p>I’m a husband,<a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/user/jamesjacques"> board gamer </a>, roleplayer, teacher, Cajun, and Texan. If that’s not a dangerous combination, I’m not really sure what is. I spent my formative years chasing the lofty ideals of academia- in particular studying Greek and Latin. This passion took me out of the south to Columbus, Ohio- my current home- where I met my wife and have established a life here.</p>

	<img class="image" src="images/meandc.png" alt="Me and my wife"/>

	<p>In my free time, I’m almost always building things. Sometimes I design my own board games or overly complicated inserts for components of other people’s board games (I’m apparently good enough to be commissioned on these). Sometimes I paint miniatures- there's nothing like painting detail on a 2 inch tall piece of metal.</p>

	<img class="image" src="images/dice.jpg" alt="dice and RPG sheets"/>
	<p> Most relevant, I build worlds. I do this in almost all my activities. For those I teach, I build a world out of the words of the long dead. With friends, I create my own worlds through roleplaying games like Dungeons and Dragons. If you want- I’ll build a world for you too, constructed of code and pictures.

		<h3 id="skillsdiv"> What I Bring You </h3>
		<hr class="long">
	<div >
		<p class="wideonly"> I have taken numerous courses online to fine tune my coding skills. I am proficient in HTML, CSS, and Javascript with a firm understanding of Responsive Web Design and Mobile First Web Design. To learn more about what I can offer you,<a href="skills.html"> click here </a>. </p>

		<div class="mobonly">
			<p> There are plenty of web developers on the internet. I count a fair share of them among my friends and twitter followers. Before I write about my skills for web development, I'd like to take a minute to talk to you about the skills I've gained outside. These are the unique offerings I can bring to you. </p>
			<hr class="short">
			<p> As an academic, I've learned that learning never stops. I've presented at national conferences numerous times, earned an advanced degree, and taught many wonderful people. By teaching at a university level for the past decade, I've learned how people learn and communicate. I believe that I excel in these regards- I will be able to tell you, in simple English, what I'm doing at every step of the way. </p>
			<p> I'm creative. This should almost go without saying: I've spent years talking about monster and made that into a paying job. I've written numerous essays on texts which have been studied for two millenia- finding new and novel ways to frame them and say something exciting about them. I believe these skills transfer extremely well into building websites: I can see your business for what it is and find new ways to attract customers by showing it at a different angle. </p>
			<hr class="short">
			<p> As far as web development skills are concerned, for HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript, I'm your guy. I've taken courses all across the internet on these topics- at well known online schools like Team Treehouse, Codeschool, and Udemy. I also have training in jQuery, AngularJS, Responsive and Mobile First Web Design practices.</p>
